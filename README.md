## 📖 Quick Start

1. Load Your MP3 Files:
   Click "Select Folder" and choose your Neuro-sama cover song folder
   The app will scan for MP3 files and extract existing metadata
2. Understand the Data Structure:
   MP3 files should have JSON metadata in their comment fields
   Typical fields:
   ```bash
   Date, Title, Artist, CoverArtist, Version, Discnumber, Track, Comment
### !!! IMPORTANT !!!
   📁metadata_presets.json📁
   have to be in same folder as main app (DF_Metadata_Customizer.exe or DF_Metadata_Customizer.py)
3. Create Rules:
   Use the Title/Artist/Album tabs to create conditional rules
   Example: "IF CoverArtist is not empty THEN Title = {CoverArtist} - {Title}"
4. Apply Changes:
   Preview changes in the bottom panel
   Use "Apply to Selected" or "Apply to All" to save changes

### 🔧 JSON Metadata Format

```bash
{
  "Title": "Original Song Name",
  "Artist": "Original Artist", 
  "CoverArtist": "Neuro",
  "Version": "2",
  "Discnumber": "01",
  "Track": "15",
