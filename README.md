## 📖 Quick Start

#### !!! IMPORTANT !!!

   The app will scan for MP3 files and extract existing metadata
2. Understand the Data Structure:

   Typical fields:
   ```bash
   Date, Title, Artist, CoverArtist, Version, Discnumber, Track, Comment, Special
3. Create Rules:
   Use the Title/Artist/Album tabs to create conditional rules
   Example: "IF CoverArtist is Neuro THEN Title = [Neuro] {Title}"
   Example: "IF CoverArtist is Evil THEN Title = [Evil] {Title}"
4. Apply Changes:
   Preview changes in the bottom panel
   Use "Apply to Selected" or "Apply to All" to save changes

   - Evil Solos (unique/total)
   - Neuro & Evil Duets (unique/total)
   - Other songs (Neuro & Vedal, etc.)
#### 🔢 Multi-Level Sorting
   Add up to 5 sort rules with custom priorities:

   3. Tertiary sort (e.g., by Artist)
   - Each sort can be ascending or descending
   - Rules can be reordered using up/down arrows
#### 🔍 Advanced Search

   - version=latest - Show only latest versions of each song
   - disc>=3 - Disc number 3 or higher
   - special=1 - Special tagged songs only

  "Title": "Original Song Name",
  "Artist": "Original Artist", 
  "CoverArtist": "Neuro",
  "Version": "2",
  "Discnumber": "01",
  "Track": "15",

  "Comment": "Additional notes"
  "Special": "0"
}
```
